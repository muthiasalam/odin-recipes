<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This grilled spatchcocked chicken is simple to do and only requires a sharp pair of kitchen shears and 5 minutes of your time. Grilling over indirect heat keeps the chicken moist.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Â¼ cup lemon juice</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
    <li>1 (4.5 pound) whole chicken, spatchcocked</li>

  </ul>
</p
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li> Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, garlic, rosemary, and tarragon together in a measuring cup.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1/2 of the oil mixture over the chicken and reserve the remaining 1/2. Using your hands, massage the oil mixture into the chicken skin. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
